## Getting started

To get a copy of this repository, please clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bowenwen/npl-natural-disasters.git

This project uses a number of machine learning libraries for Natural Language Processing, to get your local environment set up, [install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links), then create my kaggle conda environment with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environments/kaggle.yml
```

## Folder structure

There are two folders for this project, data and environments. You will need to obtain the data from kaggle's [NPL getting started competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/)
